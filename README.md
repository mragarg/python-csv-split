# python-csv-split

## What is this?
This repo contains the python scripts that will read the `past_nominations.csv` file and write to a new csv file with the specified category wanted. 

For example:
csvActor.py reads and writes all the rows with 'ACTOR IN A LEADING ROLE' category to the new file `actor_table.csv`

## Purpose?
This is to help create separate tables for the Database Management course's Term Project.
